# Where do I download and print my playbills for playing Jukebox?

Everyone who purchases a physical copy of Jukebox is entitled to both the PDF of the game, all 16 playsets that come with it, and the blank playbill. Where your PDFs are depends on where you got your copy of Jukebox.


### I backed Jukebox on Kickstarter

If you backed Jukebox at any amount above $10, you got the PDF version of the game. To make as certain as possible folks got the game, it was delivered in two ways:

1. Plus One Experience (who's distributing the physical print copies of the game) emailed out the files.
2. On February 22nd, 2025, everyone received itch.io codes in their emails.

Both of these methods sent codes to the **email address associated with your Kickstarter account**. You can see what email is associated with your account by logging into Kickstarter and got to [https://www.kickstarter.com/settings/account ](https://www.kickstarter.com/settings/account).

If you no longer have access to your Kickstarter email, please reach out via [Kickstarter message](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jarofeyes/jukebox-the-karaoke-musical-ttrpg) and let us know your new email so we can officially get you your PDF copy of the game. In the meantime, if you're about to play Jukebox and need access to the print files **now**, you can fill out the [Jukebox Playset and PDF Help Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe-1j_rUEaTqIHzXNlr_jT-MnRVAyQI2pPP6G25L-TbiT2JuA/viewform?usp=header).


### I bought Jukebox on itch.io
Log in to itch.io and navigate to [https://jarofeyes.itch.io/jukebox](https://jarofeyes.itch.io/jukebox). There, you'll see the list of files associated with the project. The playbills are these files:
