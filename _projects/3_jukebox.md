description: Jukebox is a rules-lite, GM-less karaoke roleplaying game that is an homage to musicals of the stage and screen. I designed, playtested, and laid out the entire game. The updated version, which includes developmental editing by Jacky Leung (Modiphius Entertainment) and cover art by Iliadele (Bad Bishop Games), is Kickstarting in November.
