# **Let's work together!**

Contact: [jarofeyesgames@gmail.com](mailto:jarofeyesgames@gmail.com)

I'm currently open to project management, game design, instructional design, or developmental editing work in the TTRPG space. I have experience with D&D 5e, FitD, PbtA, and indie systems. Please include your rates and timelines in any inquiries.
