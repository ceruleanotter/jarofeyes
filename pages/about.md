# **About**

Lyla McBeath Fujiwara ([@ceruleanotter](https://twitter.com/CeruleanOtter)) is an early career game designer, TTRPG adventure writer, and project manager living in Boston, Massachusetts. She’s had many past lives, from teaching high schoolers in East Africa to eight years in tech, where she worked as a developer for Google News and created online courses that taught hundreds of thousands of students to make their first mobile apps.

As a creator, she writes games that focus on intricate stories, complex characters, and mechanics that drive the narrative. Her projects include [Encounters in the Radiant Citadel](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/414428/Encounters-in-the-Radiant-Citadel), a 10-person D&D 5e project where she was the lead, layout artist, and writer, as well as [Jukebox - A Musical Roleplaying Game](https://jarofeyes.itch.io/jukebox), a karaoke-based storytelling TTRPG. Her most recent work is [Out of Luck](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/427134/Out-of-Luck), a 5e D&D heist with heart, set in the Radiant Citadel location of Umizu. She’s applied her background in educational writing to the TTRPG space, maintaining a blog about the game design process, as well as creating resources for new designers. 

She’s currently [writing a “lessons learned” series on TTRPG project management](http://jarofeyes.substack.com/). She is a volunteer Ranger for Big Bad Con and recently had her first foray into interactive theater as the production assistant and a puzzle designer for the [2022 Club Drosselmeyer](https://www.clubdrosselmeyer.com/).

In her off hours she can be found throwing lopsided ceramics, [drawing](https://www.instagram.com/ceruleanotter/), and cooking feasts for her cooperative house.
