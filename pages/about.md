Lyla McBeath Fujiwara ([@ceruleanotter](https://twitter.com/CeruleanOtter)) is a game designer and project manager living in Massachusetts. She’s had many past lives, from teaching high schoolers in East Africa to eight years in tech, where she worked as a developer for Google News and created online courses that taught hundreds of thousands of students to make their first mobile apps.

As a creator, she writes games that focus on intricate stories, complex characters, and mechanics that drive the narrative. She is a [2023 Storytelling Collective Creative Laureate](https://www.storytellingcollective.com/pages/creative-laureates) and [2023 Big Bad Con POC scholar](https://www.bigbadcon.com/poc-scholars/), and has freelanced for Gamehole Con, Bob World Builder, and Jeff Stevens Games.

Her own projects include [Encounters in the Radiant Citadel](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/414428/Encounters-in-the-Radiant-Citadel), a 10-person D&D 5e project where she was the lead, layout artist, and writer, as well as [Jukebox: A Karaoke Musical TTRPG](https://jarofeyes.itch.io/jukebox), a karaoke-based storytelling TTRPG. [Out of Luck](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/427134/Out-of-Luck), a 5e D&D heist set in the Radiant Citadel location of Umizu, was recently featured on a [D&D Beyond Community Spotlight](https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/1528-community-spotlight-5-one-shots-to-play-this?#Out-of-Luck-A-Heist-With-Heart). 

In addition to her creative work, she’s [writing a substack series on TTRPG project management](http://jarofeyes.substack.com/) and is a volunteer ranger for Big Bad Con. In her off hours she can be found throwing lopsided ceramics, [drawing](https://www.instagram.com/ceruleanotter/), and cooking feasts for her cooperative house.
