Lyla McBeath Fujiwara is a game designer and project lead living in Massachusetts. She’s had many past lives, from teaching high schoolers in East Africa to eight years in tech, where she worked as a developer for Google News and created online courses that taught hundreds of thousands of students to make their first mobile apps.

She currently is the project lead for the award-winning Cosmere RPG, which in 2024 became the highest funded tabletop Kickstarter ever. There, she coordinates a team of 20 diverse creatives working on 14 game products. She is also the book lead for the RPG's first hardcover campaign-length adventure, Stonewalkers. As the book lead, she directs the writing team and the overall creative execution of the adventure.

As a designer, she writes games that focus non-traditional mechanics, character-driven stories, and adventure design. She was a [2023 Storytelling Collective Creative Laureate](https://www.storytellingcollective.com/pages/creative-laureates) and [2023 Big Bad Con POC scholar](https://www.bigbadcon.com/poc-scholars/), and has freelanced for Evil Hat Productions, Gamehole Con, Bob World Builder, and Jeff Stevens Games. Her Broadway musical-inspired game, Jukebox: The Karaoke Musical TTRPG, successfully raised over $16,000 on Kickstarter and was profiled by both [Dicebreaker](https://www.dicebreaker.com/categories/roleplaying-game/best-games/upcoming-rpgs#jukebox) and [Polygon](https://www.polygon.com/gaming/505466/best-tabletop-rpgs-2024).
 
In addition to her creative work, she’s [writing a substack series on TTRPG project management](http://jarofeyes.substack.com/) and is the Big Bad Con crowdfunding co-lead. In her off hours she can be found throwing lopsided ceramics, [drawing](https://www.instagram.com/ceruleanotter/), and cooking feasts for her cooperative house.
